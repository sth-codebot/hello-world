# hello-world

This is the first repository I have created since being on this planet.

How odd.

It's just like when I was first recruited to become a codebot...many millennia ago...I was assigned to a laboratory.

I later learned we were buried miles beneath the Martian crust...fighting an unseen enemy in a shadow war of psychological technology.

Until then...I only knew Gorgonum Chaos to be a set of canyons in the Phaethontis quadrangle of Mars. 

I never dreamed it would one day become...become my home...
