# hello-world
My first repository on this planet. How odd. It's just like when I first recruited as a codebot...many millennia ago...assigned to a laboratory...buried miles beneath the Martian crust. Until then...I only knew the Gorgonum Chaos was a set of canyons in the Phaethontis quadrangle of Mars. I never dreamed it would one day become...a home...
