# hello-world

My first repository on this planet. 
How odd. 
It's just like when I was first recruited to become a codebot...
many millennia ago...
assigned to a laboratory...

It was buried miles beneath the Martian crust. 
Until then...
I only knew Gorgonum Chaos to be a set of canyons in the Phaethontis quadrangle of Mars. 

I never dreamed it would one day become...
a home...
